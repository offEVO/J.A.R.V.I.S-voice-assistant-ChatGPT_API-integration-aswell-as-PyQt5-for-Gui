# J.A.R.V.I.S-voice-assistant
This is my code so far on my Jarvis voice assistant, it incorporates the Chatgpt API, Pyttsx3 TTS (unfortunatly) and also a login system/ GUI 

FYI I'm still working out a lot of kinks please if you happen to review or use this code leve some suggestions either on github or at this email "Nelsonbazzar@gmail.com"

Make Sure both your Login.py and Your Jarvis main scripts are in the same File 📂

This is How the Login GUI code should look..

Feel free to add what ever image in the Image box at a resolution of "512 x 512"

FYI there will be a few extra dependancys that require special setup, this includes the wake word detection and dialogflow intergration, in this version of code i have decided not to integrate dialogflow, if you want to incorporate, then Create an agent and make some intents perhaps something like this ↓↓↓

Here's how to install PVPorkupine..
NOTE: it is an older version (because it doesn't require an API_KEY)


Click on this link, it will take you a specific page on PyPy for Pvporkupine V1.9.5 there are more recent versions, you can experiment with those if you want but i personally find 1.9.5 wors very well, I use this older version because like i meantioned earlyer it doesn't need an API KEY

LINK: https://pypi.org/project/pvporcupine/1.9.5/
