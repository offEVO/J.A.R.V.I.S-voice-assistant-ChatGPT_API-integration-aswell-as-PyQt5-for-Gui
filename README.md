# J.A.R.V.I.S-voice-assistant
This is my code so far on my Jarvis voice assistant, it incorporates the Chatgpt API, Pyttsx3 TTS (unfortunatly) and also a login system/ GUI 

FYI I'm still working out a lot of kinks please if you happen to review or use this code leve some suggestions either on github or at this email "Nelsonbazzar@gmail.com"

Make Sure both your Login.py and Your Jarvis main scripts are in the same File ðŸ“‚

This is How the Login GUI code should look..
