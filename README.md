# J.A.R.V.I.S-voice-assistant
This is my code so far on my Jarvis voice assistant, it incorporates the Chatgpt API, Pyttsx3 TTS (unfortunatly) and also a login system/ GUI 

FYI I'm still working out a lot of kinks please if you happen to review or use this code leve some suggestions either on github or at this email "Nelsonbazzar@gmail.com"

Make Sure both your Login.py and Your Jarvis main scripts are in the same File ðŸ“‚

This is How the Login GUI code should look..

Feel free to add what ever image in the Image box at a resolution of "512 x 512"

FYI there will be a few extra dependancys that require special setup, this includes the wake word detection and dialogflow intergration, in this version of code i have decided not to integrate dialogflow, if you want to incorporate, then Create an agent and make some intents perhaps something like this â†“â†“â†“

Here's how to install PVPorkupine..
NOTE: it is an older version (because it doesn't require an API_KEY)

Click on this link, it will take you a specific page on PyPy for Pvporkupine V1.9.5 there are more recent versions, you can experiment with those if you want but i personally find 1.9.5 wors very well, I use this older version because like I meantioned earlyer it doesn't need an API KEY

LINK: https://pypi.org/project/pvporcupine/1.9.5/

The Page for the Pvporkupine should look like this â†“â†“â†“

your going to want to copy the part that says "pip install pvporcupine==1.9.5" From there you need to paste that into your terminal, You will need python installed other wise the pip command will NOT work. If your using VsCode then you can simply paste it into the built in terminal â†“â†“â†“
